# EtchSketch

## About

The goal of this project was to create a that responds to a mouse hovering over the various elements similar to an Etch-A-Sketch. It combines the CSS hover function with Javascript logic to do this. This was the 2nd project I did in JS after rock, paper, scissors and it taught was valuable to learn how to used more complex logic as well as to combine CSS and JS logic to create functional and coherent applications.

## Source

I did this project as a part of The Odin Project, a great free website that is meant to aggregate all the resources necessary to go from zero knowledge to a web developer. Can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/
